make a simple API server


1. User Creation with basic user parameters i.e. name*, email*, password*, userRole*, dateOfBirth(optional), address (Optional).
2. User Editing of the above parameters (only the user himself or admin role should be able to update his account).
3. Get user by name, id, or email.
4. Get all users.
5. Delete user by id (only the user himself or admin role should be able to delete his account).


(1) Get /users                       - Render Html document
(2) Get /api/users                   - List all users JSON (for mobile developers)

(3) Get /api/users/1                 - List users by id (Get user by id-1)
(4) Get /api/users/2                 - List users by id (Get user by id-2)

(5) POST /api/users                  - Create new user

(6) PATCH /api/users/1               - Edit user by id-1

(7) DELETE /api/users/1              - Delete use by id-1


for id we can also write :id


(8) Connecting MongoDB               - Installation and connection (using MongoDB Compass)
Two ways to import data;
1. Import files into MongoDB Compass.
2. Code to import data into Database through nodejs. (importData.js)


(9) JWT TOKEN (JSON WEB TOKEN)
.env file                            - Set secretKey

(10) bcryptjs                        - for password hashing



Copy the token from the login response.
Go to jwt.io and paste the token in the Decoder section.
If it's a valid token, it will decode and show the payload. (also add secret key only in that way your token can be verified)
